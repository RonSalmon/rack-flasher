# Rack::Flasher

Flash for Rack using the FlashHash from Sinatra Flash.

## Why? ##

Because I want to use a _Rack_ flash, but Rack::Flash is difficult to use and the source makes no sense to me. [Sinatra Flash](https://rubygems.org/gems/sinatra-flash) has a nice implementation for the flash hash, it's easy to follow, all it needs is conversion to Rack middleware.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'rack-flasher'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install rack-flasher
